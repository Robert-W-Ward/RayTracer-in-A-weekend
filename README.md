# Raytracer in a Weekend C++ Project

This repository contains a C++ implementation of a raytracer based on the "Raytracer in a Weekend" series of ebooks. The raytracer is designed to simulate the behavior of light and generate realistic images by tracing the path of rays through a scene.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need a C++ compiler and the necessary dependencies installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Robert-W-Ward/RayTracer-in-A-weekend.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd RayTracer-in-A-weekend`
3. Build the project using the Visual Studio sln file
4. Run the raytracer usingg Visual Studio

## Usage

After building and running the raytracer, you can specify the scene and rendering settings in the code. Modify the `main.cpp` file to define the scene's objects, camera position, materials, and other parameters. Adjust the rendering settings such as image dimensions, samples per pixel, and maximum recursion depth to achieve the desired output.

Once you have set up the scene and rendering settings, run the raytracer to generate the image. 

## Resources

For more information and detailed explanations of the raytracer implementation, refer to the "Raytracer in a Weekend" series of ebooks by Peter Shirley. These books provide step-by-step guidance and cover various topics such as geometry, materials, lighting, and optimizations.
